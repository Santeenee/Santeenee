# Hello there! Nice to see you (〃￣︶￣)人(￣︶￣〃)

**👨‍💻 Frontend Developer | 🎶 Clarinetist | 🏔️ Mountain Enthusiast**

Based in Trento, Italy, I craft sleek, user-focused interfaces by day and bring melodies to life on the clarinet by night (since 2012 🎵). When I’m not coding or playing music, you’ll find me chasing fresh air and elevation in the Alps.
