### About me
- I have a full time job now.
  I don't know if that's good or bad,
  I just know that it will ensure some economical relax along the line besides being the n1 source of knowledge these days.
  They also bring croissants too often.
- I usually enjoy spending my free time playing the clarinet 
  (besides coding of course, I have to maintain some mental health after all...)
- Trekking lover
