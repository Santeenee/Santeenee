### ðŸ˜Ž About me
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning databases, cloud computing, web development ([Reactjs](https://github.com/santeenee/music-player-react-ts 'Music player in React-TypeScript'), [Angular](https://github.com/santeenee/learning-angular) and Svelte), computer networks and [cryptography](https://github.com/santeenee/cryptography-python 'Cryptography in Python')
- ðŸŽµ I usually enjoy a lot spending my free time playing the clarinet 
  (besides coding of course, I have to maintain some mental health after all...)
